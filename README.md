# Body Architectures
Our bodies are complex systems that are dynamic and kinetic, allowing us to navigate through the world, experience our surroundings, and communicate with others through sensing and data feedback. In order to understand our surrounding environment, we rely on our senses; sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. However, we donâ€™t visualize all of the multi-layered data information exchanges that coalesce and form dense networks that are important to take into account in multiple fields of design.

## ESP32_OSC_Sensors
This repository focuses particularly into the setting up and programming of the ESP32 Arduino to communicate sensor data over OSC to a processing sketch, or any OSC receiving software.
